Rivals

Rivals is a re-imagining of factions and a previous iteration of this plugin, geared towards a seasonal playstyle. This plugin is designed to create a more engaging and competitive environment, with seasons that culminate in a dramatic "Crisis" event.

Key Features
Season Progression and End-Game Crisis

    Season Length: Each season lasts approximately 2-3 months, guided by player progression rather than a fixed timeline.
    Crisis Event: Progression towards a season-ending "Crisis" event marks the game's climax. Killing the Ender Dragon triggers this event, making the faction that kills it the "Crisis" faction.
    Crisis Mechanics:
        The Crisis faction will be trapped in the End for a 2-day warmup after killing the Ender Dragon.
        Other factions in the End at the time are sent back to the Overworld.
        After the warmup, the Crisis faction sets a starting point at least 1000 blocks from spawn for the final battle.
        The world border will shrink over 1 hour to spawn, and respawning is disabled during this time.

Winning the Season

    Victory Conditions:
        The Crisis faction wins if it eliminates all other players.
        If the Crisis faction is defeated, the winning faction is determined by a combination of game stats and economic performance.
    Rewards for the Winning Faction:
        Design the new Spawn for the next season.
        Choose the world seed for the next season.
        Be featured in the Hall of Fame at Spawn, alongside all previous winners.
        Optionally, a statue of the player who dealt the final blow in the Crisis battle can be placed in Spawn.

Spawn and World Management

    Spawn Protection:
        Spawn is under WorldGuard protection during most of the game, used for setting up shops.
        During the final battle, WorldGuard protection is lifted, allowing non-Crisis factions to establish defensive positions.

Eyes of Ender Mechanics

    Acquiring Eyes of Ender: Crafting Eyes of Ender is disabled. They can be obtained by:
        Winning weekly community events (UHCs, PvP tournaments, building contests).
        Having the highest weekly income from server shops.
        Capturing and holding two out of three control points for the majority of a week.
        Completing specific questlines or challenges (e.g., defeating a Warden or solving a mystery).
    Special Buffs: Placing an Eye of Ender in the End Portal grants faction-wide buffs.

Control Points

    Capture Mechanics:
        Control points are located above each of the three strongholds closest to spawn.
        Capture by placing your faction's banner at the control point's center and defending it.
    Eyes of Ender Rewards: Feedback is sought on how many control points need to be held to earn an Eye of Ender weekly.

War Mongering

    War Mongering System:
        War Mongering effects decrease with distance from Spawn; near Spawn, it significantly reduces maximum health.
        Killing players far from Spawn has little to no War Mongering effect.
        War Mongering penalties recover over time, similar to lifesteal mechanics.

Politics

    Simplified Political System:
        The complex faction-based political system has been removed.
        Individual players can be elected as custodians by the community to manage and enhance Spawn.

Feedback and Development

Rivals is an ongoing project with active development. We value community feedback on balancing and feature implementation. Your input helps us refine the gameplay experience and ensures that Rivals remains engaging and fun for all players.
